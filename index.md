## Key signing policy
I will sign your PGP key if you ask me to, and I have somehow verified that the identity of the key matches your
identity. I will probably also ask you to sign my key. [More information](https://blog.graffen.dk/KeySigningPolicy)

## Old Keys
The following keys have been superseded by the above. I will keep them active for the time being but please use the above keys for all communications.
