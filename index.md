Hi! I'm Jesper. This page is just a place where I advertise my current set of crypto keys and fingerprints. So, if you wish to contact me, feel free to do so using one of the methods below.

# Contact

The following are the best ways to contact me securely and/or anonymously. My public key fingerprints are listed next to each so you can verify you have the correct information.
Since I cannot guarantee that the OTR fingerprints listed below are always 100% up-to-date, make sure you verify them through other means. For example by asking me to tweet
my current fingerprint, or by verifying it through some other trusted means.

* Email: [jesper@graffen.dk][email]  
[GnuPG][graffen.asc] Fingerprint:  `03CD 582F 13C0 682C 8F52 9C05 8417 0D85 CAEB D4B2`
If you have keybase, I prefer keybase-encrypted (and signed) messages rather than GnuPG.

# Jabber / XMPP
I run a Jabber/XMPP server that is open for anyone to sign up on and use to chat with thousands of other jabber users around the globe. See more [here][xmpp.dk].

# SSH
If for some reason you need to give me access to your server via SSH, you can use [this][sshkey] ([signed version][sshkey_signed]) SSH key initially. 
Once you have created my user, I will log in and replace the above key with key that is unique to the ssh://user@server:port combination.

For managing my SSH keys, I use a [Bitcoin Trezor][bitcointrezor]

# Crypto

### GnuPG
Read my latest GnuPG key [Transition Notice][transitionnotice]

### Key signing policy
I will sign your PGP key if you ask me to, and I have somehow verified that the identity of the key matches your
identity. I will probably also ask you to sign my key.

### Deprecated Crypto Keys
The following keys have been deprecated for one reason or another. Please don't use these to communicate with me. I haven't been too good at taking backups of my Jabber OTR keys so I've gone through a few of them.
