## Key signing policy
I will sign your PGP key if you ask me to, and I have somehow verified that the identity of the key matches your
identity. I will probably also ask you to sign my key. Find a link to my full key signing policy at the top of this page. 

## Discontinued Keys
The following keys have been superseded by the above. Please don't use these to communicate with me. I haven't been too good at taking backups of my Jabber OTR keys so I've gone through a few of them.
